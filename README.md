# Strait_of_Gibraltar
This dataset provides 3D ocean current simulations of the Strait of Gibraltar, including zonal (U), meridional (V), and vertical velocity components (W) at grid coordinates (X,Y, Z), (X: longitude, Y: latitude, Z: depth, in m). The simulation was conducted using the MIT General Circulation Model. The data set consists of 144 hourly snapshots over six days. Modelled ocean features, which include tidal flows, ocean gyres, and internal gravity waves, were analyzed using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).
