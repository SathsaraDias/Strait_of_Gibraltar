## üåä At a Glance

- **3D numerical simulation** of ocean currents in the Strait of Gibraltar (MITgcm)
- Hourly snapshots (144), 6-day time span
- Fields: Zonal (U), Meridional (V), and Vertical (W) velocities, on a regular grid
- **Key phenomena:** tidal flows, ocean gyres, internal gravity waves
- **Data format:** MATLAB `.mat`
- **Used in:** [Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition) analysis for peer-reviewed publication

## üöÄ Quick Start: Download Data with Git LFS

If you only want the `.mat` data file(s) and are new to Git or Git LFS, **follow these steps**:

### 1. Install Git LFS

- **Windows:**  
  Download and run the [Git LFS installer](https://git-lfs.github.com/), then open ‚ÄúGit Bash‚Äù or ‚ÄúCommand Prompt‚Äù and run:
```

git lfs install

```
- **macOS:**  
```

brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

```
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**  
```

sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install

````
For other distros, see [Git LFS install guide](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).

### 2. Clone and Download the Full Dataset

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Strait_of_Gibraltar.git
cd Strait_of_Gibraltar
git lfs pull
````

*Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username if needed.*

### Already Cloned but See Only a Tiny `.mat` File?

Just run:

```bash
git lfs pull
```

from inside your repository folder.

**How to use:**
- Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username or organization.
- If you have a GIF (or a key image), upload it to the repo and update the path in the `![Example: ...](...)` section.
- You can move the "Simulation Snapshot" above or below as you prefer.

---

**This version:**
- **Looks professional and modern** (use of emojis is common in research repos now‚Äîif you want, you can remove them for a more traditional look).
- **Promotes your paper** with a direct link and a badge.
- **Makes data access instructions prominent** for all users.
- **Encourages citation and open science.**

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to see an example GIF section or want to add more paper badges!
